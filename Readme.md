XHProf Helper for Google Chrome
===============================

Profiling PHP code with [XHProf](http://pecl.php.net/package/xhprof) is very powerful, but enabling
XHProf by adding a GET variable is way too hard. This extension will help you to enable/disable
profiling with ease.

How to install this extension?
------------------------------
Go to the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/) and click "Add to Chrome".
